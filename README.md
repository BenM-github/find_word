# find_word
A bash shell script I wrote to solve word quizes like 4 pictures 1 word


# TODO check at start if fzf is accessable
# TODO unknown word lenth
# TODO reset
# TODO pattern
# TODO possible letters (that dont have to be in the word | but the word can not contain different letters)
# TODO adding not listed words: gries
# TODO download ngerman (maybe different languages) to run the script without access to it
